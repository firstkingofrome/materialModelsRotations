Hello Suiwen and Houjun, if you both have a little while I think we should Skype for a bit tomorrow morning. Does 9 work well for both of you?

Hello Suiwen and Houjun, before we all talk today I wanted to have a brief recap so that we are all on the same page: Suiwen, I donâ€™t know if you saw the email

to me, Suiwen, Houjun
Please go through this very methodically so all are clear, it is essential that the ESSI input motions at the DRM boundary are all defined with the right signs so the effective vector inputs are correct, I suspect if we get this right the good results of the earlier runs for the horizontal components will be realized and hopefully z will look a little better

Ok, so just to restate what I had above more clearly: The sw4 coordinates should look like this: sw4_x=hdf5Container["vel_1"] sw4_y=hdf5Container["vel_0"] sw4_z

Here are slides of the procedures of how to generate the input motions for ESSI model. I am confused about the structure of data storage in SW4. We discuss it a

Let's look at this script for our meeting, I changed all the sw4 related coordinates into (i, j, k), instead of mixing with the essi (x, y, z).

Here's the latest converted data, I will send a document that describes how the conversion is done shortly. cubic_model_0715.hdf5

Could you also include the code that generated the container? It is easy to keep them together and that way we will always have it?

Here it is. sw4essi_converter_0715.py

Houjun I really think that we should be calling these sw4x,sw4y and sw4z, refering to them as sw4 i,j,k just adds another layer of compelxity and these points a

Also did you compare this container to the one from two weeks ago?
Eric Eckert
	
	Mon, Jul 15, 1:52 PM (2 days ago)
I am concerned because it looks like the -1* the z velocity is missing, was that absent from that container?

There is a minus sign on line 100, k_vel_all = -sw4essiout['vel_2 ijk layout']. Currently I prefer to use i, j, k for the sw4 data, we can change it to sw4 x, y

Ok thanks I did not notice that.

Suiwen, I just wanted to triple check on the z coordinates for ESSI: z=0 is always the bottom and you count up right? (so the essi point z=140 is the surface an

to Suiwen, Houjun, David
Suiwen, here is the data for the reference points, the reference points script and the output from the script. I treated 140 as the surface and 0 as the bottom. Output is in terms of ESSI coordinates and should match Houjuns conversion methodology. Please let me know if there are any discrepancies or problems. (the output .txt file shows the sw4 essi container INDEXES that I compute for each point)
